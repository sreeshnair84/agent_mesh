## 📝 Implementation Guidelines

### Creating New Pages
1. Create page component in `src/app/[route]/page.tsx`
2. Wrap with `DashboardLayout`
3. Create feature-specific components in `src/components/[feature]/`
4. Add TypeScript types to `src/types/index.ts`
5. Create service functions in `src/lib/services/`

### API Integration
1. Use the existing `apiClient` from `src/lib/api-client.ts`
2. Add new endpoints to `API_ENDPOINTS` object
3. Create service functions following the pattern in `agent-service.ts`
4. Use React Query for data fetching and caching

### Styling Guidelines
- Use Tailwind CSS classes
- Follow the established design system
- Use the predefined component classes (`.btn-primary`, `.status-badge`, etc.)
- Purple theme (#7C3AED) as primary color
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

### Component Patterns
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props
- Implement proper error handling
- Add loading states for async operations
